__DGGRID__ is a command-line application for generating and manipulating
icosahedral discrete global grids (DGGs).

Three directories should be included herein:

- `src`: contains complete source code for __DGGRID__

   There are two ways that you can build __DGGRID__: you may use `cmake`
   (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions),
   or you can use the legacy build system from previous versions of __DGGRID__
   (see the text file README.NOCMAKE for instructions).

- `examples`: contains examples of using __DGGRID__ with pre-computed outputs.

- `dockerfiles`: contains a __DGGRID__ dockerfile and instructions for use

User documentation for __DGGRID__ is in `dggridManualV81b.pdf`.
